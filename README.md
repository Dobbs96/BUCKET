## Installation
  
While BUCKET is available as a deployed app, you can also clone down the code to use it on your own local host. Please make sure you have Node.js installed to run `npm init` and `npm i` to install necessary dependencies. Make sure to add in your own .env file with your own MySQL login information. From there, run `npm start` from your terminal to start up the server and database.
  
## Usage
  
The deployed version of the page is supported on [Heroku](https://aspirational-bucket.herokuapp.com/). Sign up and start sharing your goals with other dreamers!

## Development

BUCKET is the submission for the second major project of the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp from the summer of 2021. It is a full-stack application folding in concepts from all previous units; from front-end development and design, to MySQL and database handling, to express-session and authentication. The final product represents the continued learning of four student developers.

The front-end was designed to be easy for end users to navigate. The placement of components on the homepage and user dashboard is meant to allow for easy visual flow of information.
